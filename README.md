# Learning C++ Project

Welcome to my github area on learning C++.

This area documents my journey learning a powerful, expressive and
complex programming language.

## Why I started learning c++

I originally wanted to make R run faster using the Rcpp packaged. Now I
know a few tricks I want to discover the other capabilities of the
language.

## What you will find here

I am planning to share tiny code snippets demonstrating the different
features of the language.
